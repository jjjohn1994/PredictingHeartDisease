# Kaggle Competition: PredictingHeartDisease

Introduction :

World Health Organization has estimated 12 million deaths occur worldwide, every year due to Heart diseases. Half the deaths in the United States and other developed countries are due to cardio vascular diseases. The early prognosis of cardiovascular diseases can aid in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and in turn reduce the complications. 

Objective :

This research intends to pinpoint the most relevant/risk factors of heart disease as well as predict the overall risk.
Model Training & Prediction:

In this experiment, data is split based on a ratio of 80:20 for the training set and the prediction set. With the help of different Machine Learning Models - K_Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, we can predict whether a person suffers from heart disease or not.

Performance:

K Neighbors Classifier: 87.0%
Support Vector Classifier: 83.0%
Decision Tree Classifier: 79.0%
Random Forest Classifier: 84.0%
