# Kaggle Competition: PredictingHeartDisease

Introduction :

Heart diseases is a term covering any disorder of the heart. Heart diseases have become a major concern to deal with as studies from the source 'Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics 2018 At A Glance' shows that cardiovascular disease has become one of the leading causes of death, accounting for more than 17.9 million deaths per year in 2015, a number that is expected to grow to more than 23.6 million by 2030.

Thus preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

Problem Description :

This data set currently contains 303 instances, some of which aren't complete (some features may be missing for a certain instance). In the case that this happens, the instance has been removed. There are 14 relevant features which have been extracted, from a maximum of 76 in the total dataset.

Feature #14 has also been reduced to a binary problem to detect the presence of any vessel narrowing. In the unprocessed data set, the range of values for that feature are from 0 to 4, indicating which vessel(s) are narrowing.

Objective : 

Based on the given information about each individual we have to calculate that whether that individual will suffer from heart disease.

Model Training & Prediction:

In this experiment, data is split based on a ratio of 80:20 for the training set and the prediction set. With the help of different Machine Learning Models - K_Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Random Forest, we can predict whether a person suffers from heart disease or not.

Performance:

K Neighbors Classifier: 87.0%
Support Vector Classifier: 83.0%
Decision Tree Classifier: 79.0%
Random Forest Classifier: 84.0%
